Every frame print in console "hello world"

Q4: What kind of classes are the Update and Debug.Log methods usable in? I.e., what should replace the ???s ?

"MonoBehavior"

Q5: What do these lines of code do?

10 is the parameter put for the PrintMessage function printing in the console "x = 10"

Q6: What are the name & purpose of these highlighted lines of code?

10 is the parameter of the function which can be changed and the parenthesis is what the debug is logging in the console. In this case it takes the paremeter and prints x = the integer put as the paremeter.

Q7: What's wrong with this code?

The code is not properly calling the transform variable. This would give an error.
 

Q8: What should we change in the highlighted code to fix this?

Replace the Transform with _playerTransform as Transform is the type, not the name of the variable.
