# W1

## Activity 1
Advice:
- Gauge how much time it will take to make the minigame homework, some may take longer.
- Look for help in your table mates, do not be shy!
- Looking at Unity documentation for help with implementation and function

## Activity 2
Q1: What is the value of x after these lines of code?

- x = 10

Q2: What is the value of x after these lines of code?

- x = 2

Q3: What do these lines of code do?

- Every frame print in console "hello world"

Q4: What kind of classes are the Update and Debug.Log methods usable in? I.e., what should replace the ???s ?

- "MonoBehavior"

Q5: What do these lines of code do?

- 10 is the argument put for the PrintMessage functions paremeter printing in the console "x = 10"

Q6: What are the name & purpose of these highlighted lines of code?

- 10 is the argument of the function which can be changed and the parenthesis is what the debug is logging in the console. In this case it takes the argument through the paremeter and prints x = the integer put as the argument.

Q7: What's wrong with this code?

- The code is not properly calling the transform variable. This would give an error.
 

Q8: What should we change in the highlighted code to fix this?

- Replace the Transform with _playerTransform as Transform is the class, not the name of the variable.
