# GDIM32 In Class Activities

# W1 Activity

## Activity 1
Advice:

- Look for help in your table mates, do not be shy!
- Looking at Unity documentation for help with implementation and function

## Activity 2
Q1: What is the value of x after these lines of code?

- x = 10

Q2: What is the value of x after these lines of code?

- x = 2

Q3: What do these lines of code do?

- Every frame print in console "hello world"

Q4: What kind of classes are the Update and Debug.Log methods usable in? I.e., what should replace the ???s ?

- "MonoBehavior"

Q5: What do these lines of code do?

- 10 is the argument put for the PrintMessage function printing in the console "x = 10"

Q6: What are the name & purpose of these highlighted lines of code?

- 10 is the parameter of the function which can be changed and the parenthesis is what the debug is logging in the console. In this case it takes the argument and prints x = the integer put as the argument.

Q7: What's wrong with this code?

- The code is not properly calling the transform variable. This would give an error.
 

Q8: What should we change in the highlighted code to fix this?

- Replace the Transform with _playerTransform as Transform is the class, not the name of the variable.
